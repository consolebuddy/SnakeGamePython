# SnakeGamePython
Implemented Snake Game in Python which was popular in Nokia Phones

To Run the Game :
1. Install required libraries i.e Turtle, time, random
2. run main.py file using python interpreter

I have also created .exe file from which you can directly run the game by double clicking it :
1. Go to /dist folder
2. Double click main.exe
